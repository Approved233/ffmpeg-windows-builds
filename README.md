# FFmpeg Windows Builds

[![Download FFmpeg Windows Builds](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dm/ffmpeg-windows-builds.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-windows-builds/files/)

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is a "complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video". We provide easy to use binaries for Windows.

Our binaries are compiled using GitHub Actions and made available on [SoureForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-windows-builds/) for download. Nightly builds start at midnight UTC and are available about 2 hours later. Release builds are manually triggered when new releases are made available by FFmpeg.

We are providing statically linked, 64-bit windows builds, with GPL enabled. More build types to come.
